# BinarySystem
## Python class for generating a binary star system containing a massive primary and analysing the system's evolution
As the system evolves the primary star loses mass through stellar winds changing the orbital separation of
the two stars. If the primary star fills its Roche lobe it will transfer mass to its companion. 
The mass transfer can be stable or unstable depending on the constitution of the primary's envelope, the mass ratio and the separation...
The primary eventually explodes as a supernova with a certain kick velocity, of unknown magnitude and direction.
Analysis of a range of random directions for a given kick magnitude determines whether the system remains bound after
the supernova explosion or if the secondary start is ejected to become a runaway star.
The data files contain the stellar evolutionary tracks of massive stars in the range 8-30 solar masses. 
They were calculated using the Cambridge Stellar Evolution code STARS and provided to me by the supervisor of
my bachelor thesis, Dr. Ross Church of Lund University.
